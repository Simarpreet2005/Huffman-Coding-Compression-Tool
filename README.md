# Huffman-Coding-Tool
A Java-based implementation of Huffman Coding for lossless text file compression and decompression, achieving up to 50% file size reduction for repetitive inputs. This project demonstrates efficient data compression using a variable-length prefix code algorithm, with console visualizations to enhance understanding.
